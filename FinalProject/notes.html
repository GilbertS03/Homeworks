<div id="completed" class="secondPage">Completed And Not Completed</br>
<span>During this project, I completed everything I wanted to, and was expected to complete. I created the board by using grid and formatted it nicely with CSS. 
    I completed all the main functions of the games such as rolling the dice, holding the dice, resetting, saving, and loading. Everything I need to complete was
    completed and I do not believe I left anything (to my knowledge) unfinished. I also was able to keep track of all the variables the user needed to know about
    and display them nicely.

<div id="mainData" class="secondPage">Main Data Structure</br>
    <span>I used to main data structures for this project, which may have been a mistake. I had one for the main game where it held the state of the dice, had the buttons,
        of above and below the bonus, then some defaults such as the max dice roll (6), and some of the data the user should know about. This was held together by the dice 
        being an array of dice object literals, the upper buttons being an array button object literals, the lower buttons being an array of object literals, and some other
        properties of it. The other data structure was an object literal of scores and whatnot. This had the scores of all the ones through sixes added up, as well as the three
        of a kind and full house. This also takes into consideration if the buttons have been pressed and how many times some of the buttons have been pressed.

<div id="learning" class="secondPage">Learning From This Project</br>
<span>I feel like I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to use JSON a little bit and how to save the objects to make it easier to load back things up instead of saving
    each individual variable from the project. I also learned that loading data would not be nearly as easy as I thought it was going to be. Loading was probably the hardest part
    of this entire project for me. This also taught me to think in clever ways such as with counting the dice and then adding using a contains method to see if a full house exists.
    I knew pretty much everything I needed to about the data structures and coding aspects coming into this project, but learning how to use them effectively and efficiently were 
    the hard parts. I learned that this kind of project takes time to complete and cannot be rushed because it becomes easy to get lost and not know where something is going wrong.
    I also learned that debugging something of this scale is very difficult which is why it is important to organize everything as you code instead of doing it randomly. I also learned
    how to use VSCode which was a fun aspect.
